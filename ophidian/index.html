      <h2>What is Snake Tongue?</h2>
      <p><em>Snake Tongue</em> is a constructed language (conlang) whispered through the pages of magical manuscripts and ancient reptilian rites. Officially known as <strong>Ophidian</strong>, it was once a medium of communion between magi and snakes ‚Äî and slowly became a language of secrecy, transformation, and subtle power.</p>
      <p>Spoken today by the hidden and the curious, Snake Tongue is both an artifact of arcane lore and a living linguistic experiment. With hissing phonemes, tail-like suffixes, and grammar that coils in fascinating patterns, it challenges human tongues while feeling eerily natural to say.</p>

        The oldest known reference to Ophidian comes from a mysterious medieval text: <em>De Sermone Serpentium</em> by the elusive author <strong>Ophidius</strong>. This foundational manuscript includes early phonetic charts, grammar sketches, and a lexicon of 800 words.

        Much of our modern understanding comes from <strong>Basil Gravemore‚Äôs</strong> 1930s treatise, <em>An Introduction to Ophidian: A Study of the Snake Language</em>, which attempted to systematize the fragmented records and oral traditions.

      <h2>Who Speaks It?</h2>
      <p>Historically, Ophidian was used by the magically attuned ‚Äî those who could speak to reptiles, read signs in scales, and feel the pulse of the world through heat and silence. Over time, it evolved into a symbol of mastery: <strong>a language you were not just taught, but initiated into</strong>.</p>
      <p>Now, it's spoken by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Constructed language enthusiasts</li>
        <li>Artists, writers, and game creators</li>
        <li>Those who feel kinship with serpents</li>
        <li>And maybe‚Ä¶ a few who still remember what the magi knew</li>
      </ul>
